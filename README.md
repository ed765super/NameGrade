# NameGrade
created in the beginning of my sophmore year
OS contains the names (first and last) of all the students //        (in descending order of their scores), //        their scores, and their letter grades as //        computed according to the scale: //        0 - 60: F, 61 - 70: D, 71 - 80: C, 81 - 90: B, 91 - 100: A //        The OS also contains the average score.
This is to be used as an example of my usual codin style (varys a bit over time as shown in my more recent projects)
